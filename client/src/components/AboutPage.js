      <p>Hi, I'm Manda and this is my baking shop.</p>
      <p>I made this app as my final project for Generay Assembly. </p>
      <p>
        I learned a lot about React doing this. I also learnt a lot about
        myself.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>I learnt that you should plan from the BEGINNING and not as you go.</p>
      <p>
        I learnt that it would be better to think about the MVP and how you{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        there's nobody who understands the struggle better than your classmates,
        so{" "}
      </p>
      <p>shout out to everyone who listened to me rant whilst I made this!</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>PS If you want to buy anything, you have to create an account and send me a message...</p>
